// Logic
// nth element from end
// States N - n element from front
// Traverse a fast point for n iterations from front
// so fast pointer will reach end with N - n iterations
// place a slow pointer at head at the same time which stops when fast pointer reaches end
// This way slow pointer has traversed N - n iterations from front that is n iterations from back. Now delete the element.
