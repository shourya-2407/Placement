* Java Basics

~ Variables in Java
- 3 types of variables - Static(1 for all objects of that class), Instance, Local
- Marking a variable public static ==> Global variable.
- Marking a variable public staic final => Global constant.
- Valid variable in java -> alphanumeric and underscore and dollar.
- No object variable --> It is object reference variable.
- Person myPerson = new Person()
    a. allocate space for the reference variable and name it as myPerson
    b. allocate space for the object on heap
    c. assign the object to the myPerson variable.
- All the object reference variable are of the same size, but the size varies according to the JVM.
- Instance variables get default values when not initialised.
  integers=0, float=0.0, boolean=false, reference=null
- Instance variables = defined at class level, get assigned with default values.
  Local variables = defined inside the method, cannot use uninitialised local variables.

2. Java OOPs concept

* Encapsulation: 
- combining data members and methods together in form of class.
- It hides implementation details from outside access while exposing a public interface.
- Instance variables are declared private and accessed through public getters and setters.
- Ensures internal state consistency and data security.
- It enhances reusability and ease of testing by isolating changes.

* Inheritance:
- IS-A relation, B IS-A C, so class B can extend class C.
- HAS-A relation, B HAS-A C, so class B can have an instance variable of class C.
- public members are inherited and private members are not.
- Anything that extends the reference variable can be assigned to the reference variable.
    Eg: List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();

~ Types of inheritance:
1. Single Inheritance
    [Superclass]
         |
         v
     [Subclass]

2. Multilevel Inheritance
    [Grandparent Class]
        |
        v
    [Parent Class]
        |
        v
   [Child Class]

3. Hierarchical Inheritance (multiple classes inherit from a single superclass.)
         [Superclass]
        /            \
       v              v
[Subclass 1]     [Subclass 2]

4. Multiple Inheritance (multiple inheritance is not allowed through classes but for interfaces)
    [Interface 1]  [Interface 2]
        \                /
            v         v
              [Class]

5. Hybrid Inheritance (Multiple and Multi level)
    [Superclass]          [Interface 1]
        |                    |
        v                    v
    [Subclass]           [Interface 2]
           \               /
              v         v
                [Class] 

Eg: class Dog extends Mammal implements Animal, Walker {...}


* Abstraction:
Hiding details and showing essential things to the user.

Abstraction can be achieved using 2 ways:

1. Abstract class: 
- Defined with an abstract keyword. 
- May or may not have all the abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods.
- An abstract method must always be redefined in the subclass, unless the subclass itself is abstract.
- Abstract classes can not be directly instantiated using new operator.
- Abstract class can have parameterised constructor and default constructor is always present.
- Abstract is a java modifier not applicable for variables.
- We can have an abstract class without any abstract method. This allows us to create classes that cannot be instantiated but can only be inherited. 
- There can be final method in an abstract class, but an abstract method can not be declared as final.
- The abstract keyword for declaring top-level classes (Outer class) as well as inner classes as abstract
abstract class B {
    abstract class C {
        abstract void myAbstractMethod();
    }
}
class D extends B {
    class E extends C {
        void myAbstractMethod()
        { System.out.println("Inside abstract method implementation");}
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        D outer = new D();
        D.E inner = outer.new E();
        inner.myAbstractMethod();
    }
}

- Observations in the below example:
1. Abstract class cannot be created, we can have references to abstract class type though.
2. Abstract class can contain constructors in Java. And a constructor of an abstract class is called when an instance of an inherited class is created.
3. Abstract classes can also have final methods (methods that cannot be overridden)
4. We can define static methods in an abstract class that can be called independently without an object.

Eg:
abstract class Base {
    Base(){ System.out.println("Base Constructor Called");}
    abstract void fun();
    final void finalfun(){System.out.println("Base finalfun() called");}
    static void staticfun(){System.out.println("Geeks for Geeks");
}

class Derived extends Base {
    Derived(){System.out.println("Derived Constructor Called");}
    void fun(){ System.out.println("Derived fun() called");}
}

class GFG {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        //(1) point
        Base b = new Derived(); //(2) point
        b.fun(); 

        Derived d = new Derived();
        d.finalfun(); //(3) point

        Base.staticfun();     //(4) point
        Derived.staticfun();  //(4) point
    }
}

Output: 
Base Constructor Called
Derived Constructor Called
Derived fun() called
Base finalfun() called


2. Interface:
- Provides 100% abstraction
- Could only have abstract methods (methods without a body) and public, static, and final variables by default.
- It can achieve multiple inheritances.
- If a class implements 2 interfaces and they have same methods, then only one implementation is required.
- Interfaces can be declared as private, protected or transient.
- Interface by default abstract and public.
- Variables declared in interfacec are public, static, final by default.
- Interface variables must be initialized at the time of declaration otherwise compiler will throw an error.
- Inside any implementation class, you cannot change the variables declared in an interface.
- Variable name conflict can be resolved by Interface name. For instance, Interface A and B have variable x, then access it as A.x nand B.x.

Eg:
public interface Try{
    int a = 10; //valid
    public int b = 10; //valid
    public static final int c = 10; //valid
    final int d = 10; //valid
    static int e = 10; //valid
    int x; //invalid
}

Q. What are nested interfaces?

Q. Why use interfaces when we have abstract classes?
-> The reason is, abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in the interface are final, public, and static.

Abstract class:
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();     // Abstract method (no body)

    void sleep() {            // Concrete method with implementation
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }
}

public class AbstractClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Woof! Woof!
        dog.sleep();     // Outputs: Sleeping...
    }
}

Interface:
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();        // Abstract methods (implicitly public and abstract)

    default void sleep() {         // Default method with implementation (introduced in Java 8)
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }
}

public class InterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Woof! Woof!
        dog.sleep();     // Outputs: Sleeping...
    }
}

Diff between Abstract class and Interfaces:
1. Purpose: Abstract classes share behavior among related classes; interfaces define a contract for unrelated classes.  
2. Inheritance: Abstract classes support single inheritance; interfaces support multiple inheritance.  
3. Methods: Abstract classes can have abstract and concrete methods; interfaces can only have abstract methods (default and static from Java 8).  
4. Access Modifiers: Abstract classes allow private, protected, or public methods; interfaces have `public abstract` methods by default.  
5. Constructors: Abstract classes can have constructors; interfaces cannot.  
6. Fields: Abstract classes can have instance variables; interfaces only allow `public static final` constants.  
7. Use Case: Abstract classes are for shared code; interfaces are for enforcing behavior.  
8. Performance: Abstract classes are slightly faster; interfaces were slower before Java 8 due to dynamic resolution.  

###Summary:  
Use an abstract class when you need shared code and behavior among related classes. 
Use an **interface** when you want to define a set of rules that multiple unrelated classes should implement.

* Polymorphism
1. Compile Time polymorphism:
There are 3 types:
a. Function Overloading
b. Operator Overloading
c. Template 

A. Method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters)
(method signature is method name and method parameter)
=> class Helper {
    static int Multiply(int a, int b)     // Method with 2 integer parameters
    {
        return a * b; // Returns product of integer numbers
    }
    
    static double Multiply(double a, double b) // With same name but with 2 double parameters
    {
        return a * b; // Returns product of double numbers
    }
}

B. Operator Overloading (not supported in Java)
class Complex {
private:
    int real, imag;

public:
    Complex(int r = 0, int i = 0)
    {
        real = r;
        imag = i;
    }
    void print() { cout << real << " + i" << imag << endl; }
    friend Complex operator+(Complex const& c1, Complex const& c2); //The global operator function is made friend of this class so that it can access private members
};

Complex operator+(Complex const& c1, Complex const& c2) { 
    return Complex(c1.real + c2.real, c1.imag + c2.imag); 
}

int main() {
    Complex c1(10, 5), c2(2, 4);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2; // An example call to &quot;operator+&quot;
    c3.print();
    return 0;
}

C. Template class (not supported in java)
template <typename T> T myMax(T x, T y) { // One function works for all data types. This would work even for user defined types if operator '>' is overloaded
    return (x > y) ? x : y;
}

int main() {
    cout << myMax<int>(3, 7) << endl;  // Call myMax for int
    cout << myMax<double>(3.0, 7.0) << endl; // call myMax for double
    cout << myMax<char>('g', 'e') << endl; // call myMax for char
    return 0;
}

2. Run Time polymorphism (Dynamic Method Dispatch): 
A function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. 
-> Method Overriding
   - Methods with same signature and name are overriden from the inherited class.
   - The argument list of the child class should match the parent class
   - Access modifier of the child class should be less restrictive than the parent class

class Parent {
    void Print() {  System.out.println("parent class"); }
}

class subclass1 extends Parent {
    void Print() { System.out.println("subclass1"); }
}

class subclass2 extends Parent {
    void Print() { System.out.println("subclass2"); }
}

class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Parent a; // Creating object of class 1   

        a = new subclass1();
        a.Print();

        a = new subclass2();
        a.Print();
    }
}
Output
subclass1
subclass2

* Erros Vs Exception:
- Both Errors and Exceptions are the subclasses of java.lang.Throwable class 
- Errors are usually caused by serious problems that are outside the control of program such as running out of memory or system crash.
- Erros Eg: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, NoClassDefFoundError.
- Cannot recover from some of the errors.
- Exceptions, are used to handle the errors that can occur during program execution.
- Exception Eg: NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException, IOException.
- Since exceptions can be caught and handled, it is common to include code to handle exceptions.
- Errors are of Unchecked type. Exceptions can be Checked or Unchecked type.

~ Checked Exceptions: checked by compiler at compile time. cannot be ignored, programmer should handle these exceptions.
~ Unchecked Exceptions: exceptions that occur at the time of execution. Run-time exceptions.

* Exception handling methods:
try-catch (handle exceptions), finally (runs regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught), 
throw (explicitly raise exceptions), and throws (declare exceptions in method signatures)

* Final vs Finally vs Finalise
Final: A keyword and access modifier. Final variable becomes constant. Final method cannot be overridden. Final class cannot be inherited.
Finally: finally block runs even if exception occurs or not.
Finalize: finalise method performs cleaning activities with respect to object before its destruction.

* Java Enumeration:
Java enums -> fixed set of constants or variables that do not tend to change. static and final implicitly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Arrays and Strings

* Types of Sorting algorithm:
1. Bubble Sort (swapping adjacent elements if they are in a wrong sequence)
void bubbleSort(int arr[]){
    int n = arr.length;
    for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++){
            if(arr[j] > arr[j + 1]){
                int tmp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = tmp;
            }
        }
    }
}

2. Selection Sort (find the minimum element and put it in the beginning)
void selectionSort(int arr[]){
    int n = arr.length;
    for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
        int minIdx = i;  //assuming min index is at ith element

        for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++){
            if(arr[j] < arr[minIdx]){
                minIdx = j;
            }
        }

        int tmp = arr[minIdx];
        arr[minIdx] = arr[i];
        arr[i] = tmp;
    }
}

3. Insertion Sort (Inserting an element in its right position)
void selectionSort(int arr[]){
    int n = arr.length;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        int key = arr[i];  
        int j = i - 1;

        // Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key,
        // to one position ahead of their current position
        while(j >= 0 && arr[j] > key){
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j = j - 1;
        }

        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
}

4. Quick Sort (Select a pivot, partition the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot)
void quickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
    if (low < high) {
        // Partition the array and get the pivot index
        int pivotIndex = partition(arr, low, high);

        // Recursively sort the subarrays
        quickSort(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high);
    }
}

public static int partition(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
    int pivot = arr[high]; // Choose the last element as pivot
    int i = low - 1;       // Index of smaller element

    for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
        // If current element is smaller than the pivot
        if (arr[j] < pivot) {
            i++;
            // Swap arr[i] and arr[j]
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
        }
    }

    // Swap arr[i+1] and arr[high] (pivot)
    int temp = arr[i + 1];
    arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
    arr[high] = temp;

    return i + 1; // Return the pivot index
}

5. Merge Sort (Recursively divide the array into halves, sort each half, and merge the sorted halves back together.)
public static void mergeSort(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
    if (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        // Recursively sort the left and right halves
        mergeSort(arr, left, mid);
        mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);

        // Merge the sorted halves
        merge(arr, left, mid, right);
    }
}

// Merge function to combine two sorted subarrays
public static void merge(int[] arr, int left, int mid, int right) {
    int n1 = mid - left + 1; // Size of the left subarray
    int n2 = right - mid;    // Size of the right subarray

    // Temporary arrays
    int[] leftArray = new int[n1];
    int[] rightArray = new int[n2];

    // Copy data to temporary arrays
    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
        leftArray[i] = arr[left + i];
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < n2; j++) {
        rightArray[j] = arr[mid + 1 + j];
    }

    // Merge the temporary arrays back into the original array
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if (leftArray[i] <= rightArray[j]) {
            arr[k] = leftArray[i];
            i++;
        } else {
            arr[k] = rightArray[j];
            j++;
        }
        k++;
    }

    // Copy remaining elements of leftArray, if any
    while (i < n1) {
        arr[k] = leftArray[i];
        i++;
        k++;
    }

    // Copy remaining elements of rightArray, if any
    while (j < n2) {
        arr[k] = rightArray[j];
        j++;
        k++;
    }
}

* Types of Searching algorithm:
1. Linear Search (Sequentially check each element until the target is found or the end is reached)
public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            return i; // Return index of the target
        }
    }
    return -1; // Return -1 if target not found
}

2. Binary Search (Repeatedly divide the sorted array in half, comparing the target with the middle element, until the target is found or the search space is empty)
public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid; // Target found
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            low = mid + 1; // Search in the right half
        } else {
            high = mid - 1; // Search in the left half
        }
    }
    return -1; // Target not found
}

* Operations performed on ArrayList
add(E e): Appends the specified element to the end of the list.
add(int index, E element): Inserts the specified element at the specified position in the list.
get(int index): Returns the element at the specified index.
set(int index, E element): Replaces the element at the specified index with the specified element.
remove(int index): Removes the element at the specified position in the list.
remove(Object o): Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list.
clear(): Removes all elements from the list.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the list.
contains(Object o): Checks if the list contains the specified element.
indexOf(Object o): Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element.
lastIndexOf(Object o): Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element.
isEmpty(): Checks if the list is empty.
trimToSize(): Reduces the size of the ArrayList to the current number of elements.
clone(): Creates a shallow copy of the ArrayList.
toArray(): Converts the ArrayList into an array.

* Java Strings:
- String is a java object representing a sequence of characters. 
- java.lang.String class is used to create and manipulate strings.
- String is immutable in nature.

* Java Strings class implements these interfaces: Serializable, Comparable, Charsequence
- Serializable: Allows the String object to be serialized, meaning it can be converted into a byte stream, which can then be stored or transmitted.
- Comparable: Allows String objects to be compared to each other.
- Charsequence: provides methods for working with character sequences, such as charAt(), length(), and subSequence().

Charsequence is a parent interface to String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer.
// Run Time polymorphism
CharSequence cs = null;
cs = new String("Hello");
cs = new StringBuilder("Hi");
cs = new StringBuffer("Bye");

* String vs String Buffer vs String Builder

* String pool
- Java String pool refers to the collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory.
- As String objects are immutable in nature, thus string pool came into picture.
- String pool helps in saving space for Java runtime.

Creating a String:
1. Using literals (stored in String pool)
  Eg: 
        String str = "Java"; // a new string literal created in string pool and is referenced by str
        String str1 = "Java"; // same literal created above is referenced by str1
        String str2 = "OOPs";  // a new string literal created in string pool and is referenced by str2

2. Creating a new object on Heap Memory
  Eg: String str = new String("Java");

| Feature       | ==                                           | .equals()                   | .compareTo()                     |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Type          | Operator                                     | Method                      | Method                           |
| Checks        | Memory reference (or value for primitives)   | Logical equality (content)  | Lexicographical or natural order |
| Return Type   | boolean                                      | boolean                     | int                              |
| Usage         | Primitive comparison or reference comparison | Content comparison          | Ordering or sorting              |

String str1 = "Hello"
String str2 = "Hello"
String str3 = new String("Hello");
String str4 = new String("Hello");

str1 == str2 ==> TRUE
str1.equals(str2) ==> TRUE
str1 == str3 ==> FALSE
str3 == str4 ==> FALSE
str3.equals(str4) ==> TRUE
str2.equals(str3) ==> TRUE
str3.compareTo(str4) ==> 0

str1.toUpperCase() //no change as strings are immutable, i.e. str1 will still be "Hello"
String str5 = str1.toUpperCase() // str5 will be "HELLO"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1. javac compiler compiles the java code to bytecode (code.class) and jvm converts this into something the underlying machine understands.
2. Nearly everything in java is an object.
3. Java is strongly typed language and compiler won't allow variables to hold data of another type.
4. Object lives on the Heap. 


13. What happens when the argument is object ==> We pass the copy of remote control(variable that points the object)


16. == operator (compares bits) => refer to single object on heap
17. .equals() => if 2 objects are equal.

*Inhertitance
18. IS-A relation, B IS-A C, so class B can extend class C.
19. HAS-A relation, B HAS-A C, so class B can have an instance variable of class C.
20. Anything that extends the reference variable can be assigned to the reference variable.
    Eg: List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();

*Overriding
21. You can override the inherited methods.
22. There is no term like private class, you can use inner class.
23. A class can be non public, which is inherited only by the classes of same package.
24. A modifier final -> end of inheritance.

*Polymorphism 
25. Compile-time polymorphism => ensured by method overloading
26. Run time polymorphism => ensured by method overriding 
    Parent a;
    a = new subclass1();
    a.Print(); 
    a = new subclass2();
    a.Print();
    // the above print methods were overriden.

27. Abstract classes, the ones that cannot be instantiated. But you can still use them as reference variables.
28. Abstract classes must be extended, abstract methods must be overriden.
29. You cannot have an abstract method in a non abstract class.
30. Non abstract classes are called -> concrete classes.
31. List<Object> objList = new Object();
    objList.add(1);
    int tmp = objList.get(0) // Compilation error.
    The compiler always looks for reference type and not object type.
    
    int tmp = (int) objList.get(0) // This will work.







1. Why is Java a platform independent language?
- developed to not depend on any hardware or software.
- compiler compiles the code and then converts it to platform-independent byte code.

2. Why is Java not a pure object oriented language?
- Java supports primitive data types like int, boolean, char.

3. Difference between Heap and Stack Memory in java. And how java utilizes this.
Stack Memory: all variables, methods.
Heap Memory: objects referenced from stack memory.

4. What do you understand by an instance variable and a local variable?
class Athlete {
  public String athleteName;  --------  
  public double athleteSpeed;        | --> instance variables
  public int athleteAge;      --------

  public void athlete(int name) { // local variable
    String athleteName;     --------
    double athleteSpeed;           | -> Local variables
    int athleteAge = name;   -------
  }
}

5. What are the default values assigned to variables and instances in java?
variables -> no default, compulsory intialisation else compilation error.
instances -> depends on data type, null for reference, 0 for numeric, false for boolean.

6. What do you mean by data encapsulation?
concept of hiding data atributes and behaviour in a single unit. 
helps developer to follow modularity, and ensures security of private properties.

7. Tell us something about JIT compiler.

***8. Can you tell the difference between equals() method and equality operator (==) in Java?

9. How is an infinite loop declared in Java?
-> for (;;){}
-> while(true){}
-> do{
   }while(true);

10. Briefly explain the concept of constructor overloading
constructors with different signatures.

11. Define Copy constructor in java.
// constructor that initialises the new object with old object.
class InterviewBit{
   String department;
   String service;
   InterviewBit(InterviewBit ib){
       this.departments = ib.departments;
       this.services = ib.services;
   }
}

12. Can the main method be Overloaded?
Yes, but only the default one will be called by JVM.
public static void main(string[] args)

13. Comment on method overloading and overriding by citing relevant examples.
method overloading -> methods in same class with same name, but different signatures.
method overriding -> methods with same signature and name are overriden from the inherited class.

14. Explain the use of final keyword in variable, method and class.
    Final -> non access modifier.
    a. Final variable --> constant variable, cannot be re-initialised.
       if no value assigned, can only be assigned by constructor.
    b. Final Method --> To prevent overriding.
      constructors cannot be final.
    c. Final class --> To prevent inheritance
        
15. Do final, finally and finalize keywords have the same function?
Final: value becomes fixed.
Finally: block used to execute important code, this block executes regardless of above conditions. 
Finalize: used to perform cleanup activity before destroying any object.
import java.lang.*;
Eg: 
public class Demo {
  protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    try { 
    } catch (Throwable e) { 
        throw e; 
    } finally {         //use of finally that always gets executed.
      super.finalize(); // Calling finalize() of Object class
    }
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {
    demo d = new demo();
    d.finalize(); 
  }
}

16. Is it possible that the ‘finally’ block will not be executed? If yes then list the case.
- If System.exit() is used.
- fatal errors like Stack overflow, Memory access error, etc.

17. When can you use super keyword?
-> used to access parent class' data members, constructors, methods when child has overriden them.

18. Why is the main method static in Java?
Static members belong to the classes, not to an individual object. 
If it was not static, then each object will have an instance of main method -> not acceptable by JVM. 
JVM calls the main method based on the class name itself. Not by creating the object.
There must be only 1 main method in the java program as the execution starts from the main method. 

19. Can the static methods be overloaded? 
-> Yes! 

20. Can the static methods be overridden?
Overriding or dynamic polymorphism occurs during the runtime.
but static methods are loaded and looked up at the compile time statically. Hence, these methods can't be overridden.

21. Difference between static methods, static variables, and static classes in java.
Static variables & Methods: belongs to class and not to object, gets memory when class is loaded, called directly with the help of class names.
Eg - Math.max(), .length;
Static classes: only posssible in case of inner class and inner static class works exactly like other static members.

22. What is the main objective of garbage collection?
-> frees up the memory space occupied by the unnecessary and unreachable objects by deleting them.

23. What is a ClassLoader?
- program that belongs to JRE (Java Runtime Environment). 
- loads the required classes and interfaces to the JVM when required. 
Example- To get input from the console, we require the scanner class. And the Scanner class is loaded by the ClassLoader.

24. What part of memory - Stack or Heap - is cleaned in garbage collection process?
-> Heap.

25. What are shallow copy and deep copy in java?
* Shallow Copy: //diff ref variable points the same object
    Rectangle obj1 = new Rectangle(); 
    Rectangle obj2 = obj1;
    // if obj1 changes then obj2 also changes
* Deep Copy: 
    Rectangle obj3 = new Rectangle();
    Obj3.length = obj1.length;
    Obj3.breadth = obj1.breadth;
  or
    obj2 = obj1.clone(); 
    // no impact on obj3 if obj1 changes

26. Apart from the security aspect, what are the reasons behind making strings immutable in Java?
String pool -> a storage area in java heap to store string literals.
