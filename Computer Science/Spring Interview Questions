* What are the features of Spring Framework?
1. Open-source, builds robust java applications(developed over years), lightweight, and easy to use framework.
2. Light weight: IoC containers are typically lightweight, especially when compared to EJB containers.
   It is lightweight as we can inject dependencies as per our need without having to include each of them.
3. Framework of frameworks (Integration with existing frameworks such as Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, Struts, etc.)
4. An application framework that provides features like IOC(Inversion of Control) container and DI(Dependency Injection) for the Java platform.
5. IoC container: is the core of Spring Framework. 
   It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. 
   Uses DI to manage the components that make up the application.
6. Modular Approach: Even if there are a lot of packages and classes, you only need to worry about the ones you need and ignore the rest.
   Eg: contains several modules like IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, WEB MVC, etc.
7. Central Exception Handling: provides a handy API for converting technology-specific exceptions 
   (such as those raised by JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO) into consistent, unchecked exceptions.
8. Data access framework: provides persistence APIs like JDBC and Hibernate to store persistence data in DB.
   Helps developer in managing DB connection, exceptions, and accessing persistent data through application.

* What are the main features of the Spring framework?

Event Handling – Supports application-wide event propagation.
Spring Integration – Supports integration with messaging platforms like Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.

* Explain the different modules in the Spring framework.
Core Modules
1. Spring Core – Provides fundamental features like Dependency Injection (DI) and BeanFactory.  
2. Spring Beans – Manages bean creation, lifecycle, and dependencies.  
3. Spring Context – Extends the Core module and provides ApplicationContext, internationalization, event propagation, and validation.  
4. Spring Expression Language (SpEL) – Allows querying and manipulating objects at runtime.  

Web Modules
5. Spring Web – Provides basic web-oriented features and supports multipart file uploads.
6. Spring Web MVC – Implements Model-View-Controller (MVC) for building web applications.  
7. Spring WebFlux – Supports reactive programming for non-blocking web applications.  

Data Access & Integration Modules
8. Spring JDBC – Simplifies JDBC-based database access.
9. Spring ORM – Integrates with Hibernate, JPA, and other ORM frameworks.  
10. Spring Transactions – Supports declarative and programmatic transaction management.  
11. Spring Data – Simplifies data access with repositories and abstraction layers.  

AOP & Instrumentation Modules
12. Spring AOP – Provides Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) support.  
13. Spring Aspects – Integrates with AspectJ for advanced AOP features.  
14. Spring Instrumentation – Supports application monitoring and performance tracking.  

Security Modules
15. Spring Security – Provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common security threats.  

Messaging & Cloud Modules
16. Spring Messaging – Supports messaging with JMS, RabbitMQ, and Kafka.
17. Spring Cloud – Helps build scalable, distributed microservices.

* Spring Initializr: 
  - a Web-based tool that provides simple web UI to generate the Spring Boot project structure 
    or we can say it builds the skeleton of the Spring-based application.
  - Helps to select the necessary configuration for their projects which helps you to customize and configure the project requirement 
    and automatically manage the Spring Boot Dependencies using the Maven repository or Gradle. 

* What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring?
A design pattern used in the Spring framework to manage object dependencies. Instead of creating objects manually, the Spring container injects dependencies into a class at runtime.  
DI helps in achieving loose coupling between objects and makes the application more flexible and maintainable. 

Types of Dependency Injection in Spring:
1. Constructor Injection – Dependencies are injected via a constructor.
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}

2. Setter Injection – Dependencies are injected using setter methods.
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}

3. Field Injection – Dependencies are injected directly into class fields using annotations.  
@Component
public class Car {

    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;  // Field Injection

    public void start() {
        engine.run();
    }
}

* What is the Spring Bean lifecycle?
The Spring Bean lifecycle refers to the sequence of events that occur from the creation to the destruction of a Spring bean. The lifecycle consists of the following phases:  

1. Bean Instantiation – The Spring container creates a bean instance.  
2. Populating Properties – Dependency Injection (DI) is applied to inject required dependencies.  
3. Bean Name Aware (Optional) – If a bean implements `BeanNameAware`, Spring provides the bean's name.
4. Bean Factory Aware (Optional) – If a bean implements `BeanFactoryAware`, it gets access to the BeanFactory.
5. Pre-Initialization (BeanPostProcessor) – If any `BeanPostProcessor` is registered, its `postProcessBeforeInitialization()` method is called.
6. Custom Init Method (Optional) – If a bean has a method annotated with `@PostConstruct` or defined in `init-method`, it is executed.
7. Post-Initialization (BeanPostProcessor) – The `postProcessAfterInitialization()` method of `BeanPostProcessor` is called.
8. Bean is Ready to Use – The bean is now available for use in the application.
9. Custom Destroy Method (Optional) – If a bean has a method annotated with `@PreDestroy` or defined in `destroy-method`, it is executed before the bean is destroyed.
10. Bean Destruction – The Spring container removes the bean instance.

Example of Lifecycle Methods in Spring:
@Component
public class MyBean {
    
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("Bean is going through init.");
    }
    
    @PreDestroy
    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Bean will be destroyed now.");
    }
}

* What are the different ways to configure a Spring application?
Spring provides three main ways to configure a Spring application:  
Java-based and annotation-based configurations are preferred over XML in modern Spring applications.

1. XML-based Configuration – Uses `applicationContext.xml` or other XML files to define beans.  
Eg:
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean"/>

2. Annotation-based Configuration – Uses annotations like `@Component`, `@Autowired`, `@Bean`, and `@Configuration`.
Eg:
@Component
public class MyBean {
}

3. Java-based Configuration (Java Config) – Uses Java classes with `@Configuration` and `@Bean` annotations instead of XML.  
Eg:
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}

* POJO
Plain Old Java Object (POJO) 
-> a database entity is represented by POJO.
-> POJO has the same members as the database entity.
-> POJO are not tied to any framework, any java program can use it
-> An ordinary Java object, not bound by any special restriction other than those forced by the Java Language Specification 
Properties of POJO: 
- Cannot extend prespecified classes
- Cannot implement prespecified interfaces
- Cannot contain prespecified annotations
- No restriction on access-modifiers of fields
- Not necessary to include any constructor in it
- POJO is an object which encapsulates Business Logic

* Java Beans
Java Beans => POJO with some restrictions.  
              1. They should implement serializable
              2. Fields should be private
              3. Getter setter and a no-arg consrtuctor should be present, fields should be accessed through these only.

The POJO classes are similar to Beans as both are used to define the objects to increase the readability and re-usability.
All JavaBeans are POJOs but not all POJOs are JavaBeans.

* What is the difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller in Spring?
All these annotations are automatically detected by Spring if component scanning is enabled (@ComponentScan).
@Component – A generic annotation used for any Spring bean.
@Service – A specialization of @Component used for service layer beans.
@Repository – A specialization of @Component used for DAO (Data Access Object) beans, with additional exception translation for database operations.
@Controller – A specialization of @Component used in the web layer to handle HTTP requests in Spring MVC.

* What is the difference between @Bean and @Component in Spring?
@Component:
Used at the class level to mark a class as a Spring-managed bean.
Automatically detected by component scanning (@ComponentScan).
Works with other stereotype annotations like @Service, @Repository, and @Controller.
Example:
@Component
public class Car {
}

@Bean:
Used inside a Java configuration class(@Configuration) on method level to define beans.
Typically used when we don't have access to modify the class source code.
Does not require component scanning.
Example:
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public Car car() {
        return new Car();
    }
}

* What is the difference between ApplicationContext and BeanFactory in Spring?
Both are used for managing Spring beans, but ApplicationContext is more feature-rich.

BeanFactory:
The basic container in Spring that manages bean creation and dependencies.
Uses lazy initialization (creates beans only when requested).
Does not support annotation-based features like @ComponentScan and AOP out of the box.
Example:
BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource("beans.xml"));

ApplicationContext:
A more advanced container that extends BeanFactory.
Supports eager initialization (creates beans at startup).
Provides additional features like event handling, internationalization, and AOP support.
Supports annotation-based configuration (@ComponentScan).
Example:
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");

Use ApplicationContext for most applications as it provides more features and better performance. BeanFactory is mainly used for lightweight IoC needs, such as in embedded systems.

* What is the default scope of a Spring bean? What are the different bean scopes in Spring?
The default scope of a Spring bean is singleton, meaning only one instance of the bean is created and shared across the application.

Different Bean Scopes in Spring:
Singleton (Default) – A single shared instance is created and used throughout the application. Spring container manages the bean’s lifecycle and keeps it in memory.
Prototype – A new instance is created every time the bean is requested. Spring does not manage the lifecycle beyond initialization.
Request (For Web Applications) – A new instance is created per HTTP request.
Session (For Web Applications) – A new instance is created per HTTP session.
Application (For Web Applications) – A single instance is created per ServletContext.
WebSocket (For Web Applications) – A single instance is created per WebSocket session.

3. Spring MVC framework: 
   Web Browser -> Front controller --(model)--> Controller --(model)--> View -> Web Browser
   Model: data of appplication. object or collection of object.
   Controller: contains business logic of application. marked by @Controller.
   View: represents provided info in a particular format. JSP+JSTL used to create view page.
   Front Controller:  In Spring Web MVC, the DispatcherServlet class works as the front controller. 
   Responsible to manage the flow of the Spring MVC application.

         Request (0)
           |
           v
     Dispatcher Servlet (1)
       |               ^  \
       v               |   \
    Handler Mapping(2) |  ViewResolver (5)
       |               |     |
       v               |     v
    Controller(3)      |    View (6)
       |               |
       v               |
    ModelAndView (4)----

   As displayed in the figure, all the incoming request is intercepted by the DispatcherServlet that works as the front controller.
   The DispatcherServlet gets an entry of handler mapping from the XML file and forwards the request to the controller.
   The controller returns an object of ModelAndView.
   The DispatcherServlet checks the entry of view resolver in the XML file and invokes the specified view component.

* Difference Between Spring DAO vs Spring ORM vs Spring JDBC
1. Spring-DAO: is not a spring module. It does not provide interfaces or templates to access the data.
   Annotate them with @Repository so that exceptions linked to the underlying technology (JDBC, Hibernate, JPA, etc.) 
   are consistently translated into the proper DataAccessException subclass.
2. Spring ORM: Spring-ORM is an umbrella module that covers many persistence technologies, namely JPA, JDO, Hibernate and iBatis. 
   For every individual technology, integration classes are provided by Spring.
   For each technology, the configuration basically consists in injecting a DataSource bean into some kind of SessionFactory or EntityManagerFactory etc. bean. 
   For pure JDBC, there's no need for such integration classes (apart from JdbcTemplate), as JDBC only relies on a DataSource.
3. Spring JDBC: Spring-JDBC provides the JdbcTemplate class, that removes plumbing code and helps you concentrate on the SQL query and parameters. 
   You just need to configure it with a DataSource. 

* Spring Framework Architecture:
1. Spring Core Module: provides the IoC container.
   There are two types of implementations of the Spring container: Bean factory and Application context.
2. Spring AOP Module: AOP breaks down the programs into aspects or concerns. Regular classes annotated with @Aspect annotation.
   These aspects help in transaction management and logging and failure monitoring of an application.
3. Spring ORM Module: used for accessing data from databases in an application. Provides APIs for manipulating databases.
4. Spring Web MVC Module: implements the MVC architecture for creating Web applications. 
5. Spring Web Flow Module: an extension of the Spring Web MVC module. 
   Helps in defining XML file or Java Class that manages the workflow between different pages of a Web application.
6. Spring Web DAO Module: provides DAO support by using data access technologies such as JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO.
   Multiple implementations are available for each data access technology supported by the Spring framework.
7. Spring Application Context Module: implements MessageSource interface and provides the messaging functionality to an application.
